{"topic": ["Fear", "Horror", "Political"], "summary": "Jakub Zolkos\nHU 250: Supernatural Horror in American Literature and Film\nProfessor Regina Hansen\nApril 14, 2023\nProject Proposal and Annotated Bibliography\nThe Politics of Fear: The Role of Horror in Political Campaigns and Media\nBy exploring \nthe ways in which Invasion of the Body Snatchers  was able to use horror to influence public \nopinion, this source can help to support the thesis that horror is an effective tool for political \nmanipulation.\nMy thesis contends that the horror genre is being increasingly utilized to develop a sense of \nfear and uncertainty in society for political gain and will argue for its effectiveness in the face of \npsychology of fear, human biology and evolutionary predispositions that shape societal response to \nhorror.Later, I would like to explain how early \nhorror movies, such as \u201cInvasion of the Body Snatchers\u201d, utilized those evolutionary \npredispositions to gain popular support and present the ways modern politicians and media outlets \nleverage elements of horror to sway voters and further certain agendas.The article can also be used to provide evidence for \nthe effectiveness of fear-based politics, as it suggests that the experience of fear can promote certain\ninvoluntary behaviors in targeted groups of people.\n", "paragraphs": [{"text": "Jakub
