Recently, autoencoderhas been widely used in image anomaly detection without using anomalous images during training.However, it is hard to determine the proper dimensionality of the latent space, and it often leads tounwanted reconstructions of the anomalous parts. To solve this problem, we propose a novel methodbased on the autoencoder. In this method, the latent space of the autoencoder is estimated using a discreteprobability model. With the estimated probability model, the anomalous components in the latent spacecan be well excluded and undesirable reconstruction of the anomalous parts can be avoided. Speci\ufb01cally,we \ufb01rst adopt VQ-VAE as the reconstruction model to get a discrete latent space of normal samples. Then,PixelSail, a deep autoregressive model, is used to estimate the probability model of the discrete latentspace. In the detection stage, the autoregressive model will determine the parts that deviate from thenormal distribution in the input latent space. Then, the deviation code will be resampled from the normaldistribution and decoded to yield a restored image, which is closest to the anomaly input. The anomalyis then detected by comparing the difference between the restored image and the anomaly image. Ourproposed method is evaluated on the high-resolution industrial inspection image datasets MVTec ADwhich consist of 15 categories. The results show that the AUROC of the model improves by 15 %overautoencoder and also yields competitive performance compared with state-of-the-art methods.Keywords: anomaly detection; anomaly localization; autoencoder; VQ-VAE; PixelSnail; MVTec AD1. IntroductionOne of the key factors in optimizing the manufacturing process is automatic anomaly detection,which makes it possible to prevent production errors, thereby improving quality and bringing economicbene\ufb01ts to the plant. The common practice of anomaly detection in industry is for a machine to makejudgments on images acquired through digital cameras or sensors. This is essentially an image anomalydetection problem that is looking for patterns that are different from normal images [ 1]. Humans caneasily handle this task through awareness of normal patterns, but this is relatively dif\ufb01cult for machines.Unlike other computer vision tasks, image anomaly detection suffers from some of the following inevitablechallenges: class imbalance, variety of anomaly types, and unknown anomaly [ 2,3]. Anomalous instancesare generally rare, whereas normal instances account for a signi\ufb01cant proportion. In addition, distinct andAppl. Sci. 2020 ,10, 8660; doi:10.3390/app10238660 www.mdpi.com/journal/applsciAppl. Sci. 2020 ,10, 8660 2 of 19even unknown types can be exhibited in anomalies such as varied sizes, shapes, locations, or textures.Therefore, it is almost impossible to capture a large number of abnormal data containing all anomalytypes. Many methods are instead designed in a semi-supervised way, using only normal images astraining samples.Some methods usually consider the anomaly detection problem as a \u201cone-class\u201d problem that initiallymodels the normal data as background and then evaluates whether the test data belong to this backgroundor not, by the degree of difference from the background [ 4]. In the early applications of surface defectdetection, the background is often modeled by designing handmade features on defect-free data. Forexample, Bennatnoun et al. [ 5] adopt texture primitives called blobs [ 6] to uniquely characterize the\ufb02awless texture and to detect defects through changes in the attributes of blobs. Amet et al. [ 7] use wavelet\ufb01lters to obtain subband images of defect-free samples, then extract the co-occurrence features of subbandimages, from which a classi\ufb01er is trained to defect detection. However, most of these methods focus ontextures that are periodic and monotonic while less valid for randomly natural textures.Recently, deep learning techniques have been widely used in computer vision related tasks. It canautomatically extract hierarchical features from the data and learn rich semantic representations, avoidingthe need for manual feature development. Deep generative models as a sub-domain of deep learningtechniques can model data distribution. AutoEncoder including its variants (AEs) is an important branch,as it has a unique reconstruction property that is widely used in anomaly detection tasks. AEs can map theinput data nonlinearly into a low-dimensional latent space and reconstruct back into the data space. Thesemodels are trained in an unsupervised way by minimizing input and output errors. Some work [ 8\u201311]exploits the characteristics of AEs to use only normal images during training in an attempt to restrict thelatent space dimension and capture the manifold of normal images. They assume that this will result inAEs failing to reconstruct well during prediction due to anomalous images deviating from the normalmanifold. These works use reconstruction errors as scores for identifying anomalies with larger meaningmore likely to be anomalies. However, AEs are originally designed for reconstruction, whose performanceto be tightly coupled with the size of the latent space [ 12]. With no knowledge of the essential dimensionof the data, setting the dimension of the latent space too small or too large would cause potential problemsfor AE-based anomaly detection methods. A large setting may result in undetectable anomalies causedby good reconstruction of anomalous images, and conversely may result in false detection of normal asabnormal. We propose a method to circumvent the above problems by adopting an AE-like model withstrong reconstruction performance for the purpose of reducing false detections. To solve the problemthat anomalies can also be reconstructed caused by excessive reconstruction capability, we introduce adeep autoregressive (DAR) model. By using DAR to constrain the latent space of the anomalous imagein the distribution of normal images, AE can reconstruct the normal sample closest to the correspondinganomalous image. Based on this framework, we also propose a novel anomaly score to further improveanomaly detection, which exploits the residuals of both reconstructions with and without latent spaceconstraints. We use VQ-VAE [ 13] applied to the compression task as the reconstruction model for theproposed method, with VQ-VAE providing a discrete latent space that can improve the modeling ef\ufb01ciencyof DAR. For the DAR model, as PixelSNAIL [ 14] can generate an image by modeling a joint distribution ofpixels as well as giving the likelihood of each pixel, we use it as the tool to constrain the distribution oflatent space. The proposed method is evaluated on the large-scale real-world industrial image datasetMVTec AD [ 15] and compared it with several major anomaly detection methods. The experiments showthat our method yields better performance compared with the state of the art.The main contributions of this paper are as follows:Appl. Sci. 2020 ,10, 8660 3 of 191. We propose a novel method only using normal data for image anomaly detection. It effectivelyexcludes the anomalous components in the latent space and avoids the unwanted reconstruction ofthe anomalous part, which achieves better detection results.2. We propose a new method for anomaly score. The high anomaly scores are concentrated in theregions where anomalies are present, which will reduce the noise introduced by the reconstructionand improve precision.The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews the related work of imageanomaly detection. A detailed description of our proposed method is given in Section 3. Section 4 presentsexperimental setups and comparisons. The conclusion is \ufb01nally summarized in Section 5.2. Related WorkThere exists an abundance of work on image anomaly detection over the last several decades, and weoutline several types of methods related to the proposed approach.2.1. Feature Extraction Based MethodFeature extraction-based methods generally map images to the appropriate feature space anddetect anomalies based on distance. Generally, feature extraction and anomaly detection are disjointed.Abdel-Qader et al. [ 16] proposed a PCA-based method for concrete bridge deck crack detection. They \ufb01rstuse PCA to get dominant eigenvectors of tested image patches and then calculate the European distancefrom the dominant eigenvectors of normal image patches. Liu et al. [ 17] used SVDD to detect defectsin TFT-LCD array images. They described an image patch with four features including entropy, energy,contrast, and homogeneity and trained an SVDD model using normal image patches. If a feature vectorlies outside the hypersphere found by SVDD during testing, the image patch corresponding to this featurevector is considered anomalous. Similar works can be found in [ 18\u201320]. Compared to these traditionaldimensionality reduction models, a convolutional neural network (CNN) provides nonlinear mappingand is better at extracting semantic information. There are two common practices for applying CNN forfeature extraction, one is to use a pre-trained network, such as VGG or ResNet, and the other is to developa deep feature extraction model speci\ufb01cally for the purpose. For example, Napoletano et al. [ 21] used apre-trained ResNet-18 to extract feature vectors from the scanning electron microscope (SEM) images toconstruct a dictionary. In the prediction phase, a tested image is considered anomalous if the averageEuclidean distance between its feature and its mnearest neighbors in the dictionary is higher than thethreshold. The other is the Deep SVDD model developed by Ruff et al. [22] who combine CNN withSVDD. They trained the deep neural network by minimizing the volume of the hypersphere containingfeature vectors of the data.2.2. Probability Based MethodThese methods assume that anomalies occur in low probability regions of the normal data, andthe main principle is as follows: (i) Establish the probability density function (PDF) of normal data; (ii)Evaluate the test samples by PDF and low probability density values are most likely to be abnormal.There are various methods depending on the distribution assumptions, such as Gaussian [ 23], GaussianMixture Model (GMM) [ 24] or Markov random \ufb01elds (MRF) [ 25]. For instance, B\u00f6ttger et al. [ 26] improvedon the framework of [ 23], they applied the CS theory [ 27] to compress defect-free texture patches intotexture features and use GMM to estimate their probability distributions. In the detection stage, a pixel isconsidered to be defective if the likelihood of the local patch corresponding to it is less than the thresholdvalue. Recently deep learning methods have improved PDF estimation performance. Due to the powerfulimage generation capability of deep autoregressive (DAR) model, it is also used for anomaly detection.Appl. Sci. 2020 ,10, 8660 4 of 19Richter et al. [ 28] applied PixelCNN[ 29] to circuit board images that predicted pixel likelihood to anomalydetection, but it may not work well in more complex natural images. One advantage of the DAR modelis that it can give the likelihood for each pixel, but Shafaei et al. [ 30] recently compared several anomalydetection methods, whose anomaly scores are given as softmax output, Euclidean distance, likelihood,etc. The experimental results show that PixelCNN++ using likelihood as the anomaly score has a loweraccuracy than the mean. This shows that it is unsuitable to use low likelihood values as the anomaly scoredirectly. Our method combines the advantages of DAR, using likelihood for resampling instead of scoringdirectly. On the other hand, we use DAR to estimate density for a low-dimensional discrete latent space,which avoids the problem of \u201ccurse of dimensionality\u201d to improve modeling ef\ufb01ciency.2.3. Reconstruction Based MethodThe assumption of this kind of method is that normal images can be reconstructed from latentspace better than anomalous images. Early defect detection works utilized sparse dictionary [ 31,32] forreconstruction. Deep learning techniques have extended the toolbox of reconstruction-based methods.Autoencoder-like models are the commonly-used model for these kinds of methods. Generally, AE-likebased methods can be summarized as (i) training AE from only normal samples; and (ii) anomalysegmentation based on reconstruction error of input samples, which may have anomalies. Baur et al. [10]applied AE directly to detect pathologies in Brain MR Images. In particular, VAE attempts to detectanomalies through the generated perspective. Some work [ 8,11] assumes that VAE trained on normalimages will only be able to reconstruct normal images, thus getting larger reconstruction errors inanomalous regions. Since the essential dimensions of the data are not known, information may be lostafter a bottleneck and even normal parts may not be reconstructed correctly, resulting in false detections.Several approaches have been proposed to address this issue. Bergmann et al. [9] thought `p-distancewould enlarge slightly reconstruction errors and replaced it with SSIM. Nair et al. [ 33] are the \ufb01rst touse uncertainty estimate based on Monte Carlo dropout for lesion detection. They perform dropoutoperation on AE and then take the variance of result as anomaly score. Both Venkataramanan et al. [ 34]and Liu et al. [ 35] implemented Grad-CAM [ 36] into AE, aiming to replace reconstruction errors withthe attention mechanism and achieving outstanding performance. Haselmann et al. [ 37] treated anomalydetection as an inpainting problem that uses AE trained on the normal dataset to generate patches clippedon the image. Dehaene et al. [ 38] argued that learning only on normal manifold does not guaranteegeneralization outside of the manifold, which will lead to unreliable reconstruction. They used iterativeenergy-based projection to sample the closest normal image to the anomalous input on normal manifold.Another is to apply Generative adversarial networks (GAN), and Schlegl et al. [ 39] used GAN to modelnormal OCT images of retina distribution. At the time of the prediction, searching the latent space forsuitable latent codes makes the generator yield the normal sample closest to the anomalous input, andthen use `1distance as anomaly score. Soon after, Schlegl et al. [ 40] optimized the search process beforethe generator. Similarly, GANomaly [ 41] adds GAN\u2019s discriminator to AE and encodes the reconstructedimage for detecting the anomalies in X-ray images by summing the errors of latent code, reconstructionerror, and adversarial loss as anomaly scores. However, GAN suffers from pattern collapse that may yieldplausible samples and cause false alarms.3. MethodThis section describes the principles of our proposed method. The \ufb01rst step is to train a VQ-VAEusing anomaly-free images as training data. When VQ-VAE can embed anomaly-free images into acompact discrete latent space and reconstruct high-quality outputs, we start performing the second step.All anomaly-free images are \ufb01rst encoded using the trained VQ-VAE to collect a latent code set, and thenAppl. Sci. 2020 ,10, 8660 5 of 19the probability distribution of this latent code set is estimated using PixelSNAIL. At the prediction stage,when the latent code of an input image is out of the distribution learned in the second step, PaxielSNAILwill conduct resampling operations on it. The resampled latent code is decoded as a restored image, whichis used for anomaly detection by calculating the error with the directly reconstructed image. The overallwork-\ufb02ow of the proposed method is shown in Figure 1; in the following, we describe it in detail.ReconstructedImage \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc51\u22ef \u22ef\u22efresblockresblock\u22ef\ud835\udc5d(\ud835\udc67\ud835\udc56|\ud835\udc671,\u2026,\ud835\udc67\ud835\udc56\u22121)\ud835\udc67\ud835\udc521\ud835\udc67\ud835\udc5eInput Image \ud835\udc65codebok \ud835\udc38\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc67\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc57index table  set\ud835\udc67(1),\u2026,\ud835\udc67(\ud835\udc41)Step 1.

Step 4.Figure 1. Pipelines of the proposed framework. The top is the training stage, and the bottom is theprediction stage. The framework for VQ-VAE comes from Oord et al. [13].3.1. Structuring Latent SpaceVQ-VAE is originally proposed as a compression model with good results, and we use it as areconstruction model to construct the latent space. It is different from VAE; VAE assumes that the latentspace satis\ufb01es a Gaussian prior and reconstructs using the re-parameterization trick, which implies that theprocess of getting the latent representation is indeterministic. However, VQ-VAE encodes the input to thelatent representation with a deterministic mapping and reconstructs data from quantized vectors. VQ-VAEprovides a suf\ufb01ciently large latent space dimension, resulting in far better reconstruction performancethan VAE and AE. Since the latent space is discrete, it can be modeled by deep autoregressive models, andthe estimated probability distribution is the basis for the proposed resampling operation.VQ-VAE consists of an encoder, a codebook with Kembedding vectors e2RK\u0002D, and a decoder.The method trains discrete latent variables z2RM\u0002Nusing the codebook combined with nearest neighborsearch, which is performed on the encoder output ze2RM\u0002N\u0002Dusing the `2-distance. Then, the vectorsin the codebook replace zeto yield zq2RM\u0002N\u0002Das input to the decoder, where zis used as the indextable for zetransformation to zq. The model optimizes the parameters of the encoder, decoder, andcodebook, with the goal of minimum reconstruction errors.Speci\ufb01cally, as shown in step 1 in Figure 1, given an anomaly-free input image x, the encoder \ufb01rstencodes xinto M\u0002ND-dimensional vectors zethat maintain the two-dimensional spatial structure of theAppl. Sci. 2020 ,10, 8660 6 of 19image. These vectors are then quantized based on their nearest distance to the embedding vectors e1,2,..., kin the codebook; the process can be de\ufb01ned by Equation (1):zi=arg minj2f1,...,Kg\r\r(ze)i\u0000ej\r\r2(1)This quantization process is essentially a lookup process, resulting in an index table z. The indextable maintains the same spatial structure as ze, whose value for each component is the sequence numberof embedding vectors in the codebook. Each vector in zewill be replaced by the enearest to it beforedecoding, where eis selected directly in the codebook based on the value of the corresponding position inz, as shown in Equation (2):(zq)i=ezi(2)Finally, the decoder maps this replaced vectors zqback to the image xd. With the quantizationoperation, the discrete zcan represent the whole latent space, and thus changing the value of zatprediction stage can generate the desired reconstructed images.To learn these mappings, we randomly initialize e1,2,..., kby sampling in the Gaussian distributionN(0, 1)before training and through the loss function described in Equation (3) to train the model, wheresg[\u0001]operation represents equality in forward propagation and zero derivative in backward propagation:L=kx\u0000xdk2+ksg[ze]\u0000zqk2+bkze\u0000sg[zq]k2 (3)The entire loss function has three components. The \ufb01rst term is reconstruction loss, which encouragesthe output to be as close to the input as possible. The second term is used to constrain the embeddingvectors in the codebook, minimizing the loss of information caused by replacing zewith zq. Beforecomputing this term, indices of the nearest embedding vectors to zeare computed, and then zqiscomposed based on the index lookup. To prevent zefrom \ufb02uctuating too frequently, the \ufb01nal term is usedto normalize ze. During training, zeis required to guarantee the quality of the reconstruction, and zqisrelatively free. A weight factor bis set with the expectation that \u201clet zqgo closer to ze\u201d more than \u201clet zego closer to zq\u201d.3.2. Probabilistic Modeling for Latent SpaceIn order to constrain the latent space, a distribution of the latent space of normal images needsto be estimated. Deep autoregressive models allow for stable, parallel, and easy-to-optimize densityestimation of sequence data. Another advantage is the ability to provide data likelihood, which makesour anomaly detection possible. PixelCNN [ 29] was one of the \ufb01rst autoregressive models implementedusing convolutional neural networks applied to image generation, and many improved models have beendeveloped based on it. Here, we use PixelSNAIL [ 14], an enhanced version of PixelCNN that adds theSelf-Attention mechanism [42] to model long-term dependencies.To estimate the probability distribution of the image, PixelSNAIL transforms the joint distributionof all pixels into a product of chain probabilities as shown in Equation (4). Each pixel is modeled as aconditional distribution, indicating the current pixel value is determined by all pixels preceding it:p(x) =p(x1, . . . , xn)=n\u00d5i=1p(xijx1, . . . , xi\u00001) (4)The conditional distribution p(xijx<i)is parameterized by a convolutional neural network and\ufb01nally connected to a softmax layer to estimate the probability of 256 values. Mask convolution is usedAppl. Sci. 2020 ,10, 8660 7 of 19to guarantee the conditional relationship preventing the model from reading pixels below. The wholetraining process can be parallelized using the GPU.When the VQ-VAE training is completed, as shown in step 2 in Figure 1, we extract the index table setnz(1),z(2), . . . , z(N)oby encoding all Nnormal images. For any z(i)in the index table set, since it recordsonly the index of the embedded vector in the codebook, one can treat it as a single-channel image. Each\u201cpixel\u201d in the index table has Kpossible values, depending on the size of the codebook.The process of modeling the probability distribution of the index table by PixelSNAIL is analogous tothe process for a low-resolution image as described above. The network is trained using the cross-entropyloss function with the expectation that the inference of the network will be identical to the true index. Aftertraining, the network can capture the pattern of normal images in latent space, predicting the most likelycurrent index number based on the preceding index order.3.3. Resampling OperationVQ-VAE\u2019s powerful reconstruction capability implies that it also has strong generalization capability.During the prediction stage, unseen anomalous images are encoded whose latent codes deviate from thedistribution of normal images, and this caused values in index tables to change as well. Our intention is toreconstruct a normal image that most closely matches the corresponding anomalous image. The word\u201cclosest\u201d is achieved by means that only the areas where anomalies exist are restored, while the normalareas remain unchanged. Since the index arrangement of the index table determines the \ufb01nal latent codeto be decoded, the restored image can be reconstructed by updating the value in the index table that doesnot satisfy the normal image pattern.Speci\ufb01cally, as shown in step 3of Figure 1, an anomalous image \u02dcxis pushed into the encoder networkand extracted an M\u0002Nindex table \u02dcz. Then, the trained PixelSNAIL model infers the likelihood on eachcomponent of \u02dczin parallel. In this process, PixelSNAIL will estimate the conditional distribution of currentcomponent of \u02dczbased on arrangement characteristics of the preceding. If the component of \u02dczis assignedan extremely low likelihood, it means that the index does not conform to the pattern of normal images. Weset a hyperparameter threshold hto identify these anomalous patterns, and the setting of this threshold isdescribed in detail in the experimental section. When the likelihood of the current component is less thanthe threshold h, we perform a resampling operation in the conditional distribution of that component,generating a new index that is most likely to occur under the semantics of the preceding normal pattern.The entire resampling process is carried out in raster order, ensuring that the pre-sequence arrangementfollows the normal images\u2019 pattern.The resampling operation can be de\ufb01ned by Equation (5), where I(m,n)means the minimumconditional probability given the bottom half of the 8-neighbor of \u02dczm,n, 1<m,n<M,N:\u02dczm,n=8><>:arg maxk02f1,...,Kgp(Zm,n=k0j\u02dczi,j<m,n)ifp\u0000Zm,n=kj\u02dczi,j<m,n\u0001<hand I(m,n)<hk others(5)We assume that anomalous region usually has local continuity, and, based on this assumption, we adda local constraint I(m,n)<hto increase the stability of the resampling. As Figure 2 shows, the probabilitydistribution of the current component (red zone) is conditioned only on previous sequences, lacking thesemantic information underneath it. We introduce the likelihood about the bottom half (yellow zone) ofthe current component\u2019s 8-neighbor to avoid noise. Resampling operation is applied when the likelihoodof both current component and at least one component in the bottom half is less than the threshold.Appl.

Diagram of the resampling condition.3.4. Detection of AnomaliesBased on indexes recorded in the resampled index table, the corresponding embedding vectors can beextracted from the codebook to yield the normal quantized latent code. After that, the decoder maps thisquantized latent code back to the image space to reconstruct the restored image \u02dcxr. Reconstruction-basedmethods typically calculate the reconstruction error of the input and output the anomaly score, withhigher scores representing more likely anomalies. However, we chose the `2-distance between the VQ-VAEdirectly reconstructed image \u02dcxdand the restored image \u02dcxrwhich is de\ufb01ned in Equation (6), as the anomalyscore to perform anomaly detection:A(i,j) =k\u02dcxr(i,j)\u0000\u02dcxd(i,j)k2(6)We argue that the VQ-VAE model is applied to compression, the reconstruction may only lose somedetails, but the semantics of the raw image is not changed. In addition, anomalies are typically smallin both size and proportion to the image being processed [ 1], and VQ-VAE has enough generalizationcapability to reconstruct these unseen anomalies. As resampling operation is applied only to componentswith very low likelihood values in the index table, the results calculated using Equation (6) will onlyhave high anomaly scores in certain regions, reducing the possibility of false alarms. We veri\ufb01ed theproposed anomaly score in the experimental section, and the results also show that ours is better thanusing traditional detection methods.After getting the residual map, we apply a smoothing post-processing using bilateral \ufb01ltering. Thesmoothed anomaly score map shows the anomaly score for each pixel, and the \ufb01nal segmentation can beobtained by binarization operation to identify the location of the anomaly.Some visual examples of the above process are given in Figure 3. Since images are mapped to a uni\ufb01edlatent space that is quantized as a discrete and solidi\ufb01ed codebook, PixelSNAIL can easily determinewhether to resample from the distribution of normal images based on a \ufb01xed threshold, followed bythe decoder generating an anomaly-free sample closest to the input. Figure 3c shows restored imagesdecoded from resampled index tables. Comparing with the original images in Figure 3a, one can see thatthe decoder only regenerates for the parts that have anomalies, but not for the whole image. As shownin Figure 3d, VQ-VAE can still reconstruct unseen anomalies, maintaining the structure of the originalAppl. Sci. 2020 ,10, 8660 9 of 19images. By comparing these two reconstructed images, it is possible to obtain areas that are consideredanomalous as shown in Figure 3b.(a) Anomaly Image(d)DirectlyReconstructed Image(c)RestoredImage(b)AnomalyScore MapFigure 3.

We used the MVTec AD dataset forevaluation. In this section, we \ufb01rst describe the composition of the dataset and some training settings.Secondly, the detection performance of the proposed model is veri\ufb01ed by comparing it with other methods.Thirdly, we performed ablation experiments to demonstrate the effects of the proposed anomaly score andthe local constraint.4.1. DatasetWe evaluate the performance of the proposed method on the comprehensive natural image anomalydetection dataset: MVTec AD dataset [ 15]. The MVTec AD dataset provides over 5000 high-resolutionAppl. Sci. 2020 ,10, 8660 10 of 19images divided into \ufb01ve texture and 10object categories. Texture types cover both regular (carpet,grid) and random (leather, tile, wood) cases, while the remaining 10objects contain rigid, \ufb01xedappearance (bottle, metal nut), deformable (cable), and natural variation (hazelnut) cases. The datasetcon\ufb01gures a scenario that only provides normal images during training. For each class, the trainingset is only composed of anomaly-free images, and the test set consists of anomaly-free images aswell as images containing 73different types of \ufb01ne-grained anomalies, such as defects on the objects\u2019surface like scratches or dents, structural defects like distortion of object parts, or defects due to themissing parts of certain objects. Pixel-precise ground truth labels are provided for each anomaly imageregion. The dataset overview is shown in Figure 4.

Samples of the MVTec AD dataset. The \ufb01rst row of each category is normal and the second row isone of anomalies.4.2. Evaluation MetricWe use the same evaluation criteria de\ufb01ned in Bergmann et al. [ 15] to test the proposed method\u2019sperformance. First, a minimum area of connected components is set for each category. Then, using themethod to be evaluated to predict anomaly score maps on a validation set containing only normal images.After that, binary decisions are made on these anomaly score maps by incremental thresholds. Until thearea of the largest connected component in binary images is equal to the de\ufb01ned minimum area, thisthreshold is determined as the \ufb01nal binary threshold. Based on this threshold, we calculate the average ofthe percentage of correct images that are correctly classi\ufb01ed as anomaly-free and anomaly for image-levelAppl. Sci. 2020 ,10, 8660 11 of 19detection. For pixel-level detection, evaluate per-region overlap (PRO) and the area under the ROC curve(AUROC). PRO is the relative per-region overlap of the predicted segmentation map Spwith the groundtruth Sg, and it gives greater weight to the connectivity component that contains fewer pixels:PRO =1nn\u00e5is(i)ps(i)g(7)where s(i)p,s(i)g,nare each connected component of Spand its corresponding Sgand the number of connectedcomponents it contains, respectively. In addition, the image-level and pixel-level F1 Score are alsoevaluated, where F1 score is computed as:Recall =TPTP+FN(8)Precision =TPTP+FP(9)F1Score =2\u0001Precision\u0001RecallPrecision +Recall(10)We de\ufb01ne TPas the count of images or pixels correctly classi\ufb01ed as anomalous, FPas the count ofimages or pixels incorrectly classi\ufb01ed as anomalous, and FN as the count of images or pixels incorrectlyclassi\ufb01ed as normal.4.3. Experimental SetupThe experimental environment is a computer with Intel Xeon E5-2667 CPU, 64 GB of RAM, Nvidia1080ti GPU, running Ubuntu 18.04, and we use the Pytorch library to implement our architecture.4.3.1. Data AugmentationTo diversify the training set to make the model more generalizable, we use random transforms androtations on the MVTec AD dataset to augment the training data. Speci\ufb01cally, applying random rotationselected from a set f0\u000e, 90\u000e, 180\u000e, 270\u000egand random \ufb02ip to texture categories and some object categories(bottle, hazelnut, metal nut, and screw). The remaining object categories are randomly rotated between therange [\u000010\u000e, 10\u000e]. Finally, all categories are rescaled to 256\u0002256, where texture categories are achieved byrandom cropping.4.3.2. Network SetupFor VQ-VAE parameter con\ufb01guration, the encoder is implemented as six convolutional layers withkernel size 4, stride step 2, padding 1, and followed by ReLU, one convolutional layer with kernel size 3,stride step 1, padding 1and followed by eight residual blocks, which are implemented as ReLU, 3\u00023conv, ReLU, 1\u00021conv for each block. Images are encoded as zewith shape 32\u000232\u000232. The decoder is asymmetrical structure of the encoder using transposed convolutions. The dimensionality of the codebookand zare designed as 512\u000232(K=512) and 32\u000232, respectively. The weight factor bis set to 0.25.We use the ADAM optimizer with learning rate 3e-4 and train for 100 epochs with batch size 256. ForPixelSNAIL parameter con\ufb01guration, the model consists of one residual block and one attention block,both of which are repeated three times due to the limitations of GPU memory trained for 150 epochs withbatch size 64, ADAM optimizer, and learning rate 0.0003. We set the parameters d, color sigma, and spacesigma of the bilateral \ufb01lter to (20,75,75).Appl. Sci. 2020 ,10, 8660 12 of 194.3.3. Hyperparameter SetupTo determine the hyperparameter h, we make a validation set containing negative samples shownin Figure 5 and performed a grid search on this validation set until reaching the maximum AUROC.We randomly mask the anomaly-free images with black or gray rectangles that are 1%of the size of theprototype to generate negative samples. In the experiment, we set 0.0005 as the value of h.Figure 5. Examples of a negative sample image.4.4. Comparison ResultsWe present separately the results calculated according to the three different evaluation metrics andcompared with the baseline methods listed in Bergmann et al. [ 15] as well as with other recent relatedmethods to evaluate the performance of the proposed method.Table 1 shows the average accuracy of correctly classi\ufb01ed anomalous and normal images, whichdemonstrates the ability of the method in the image-level classi\ufb01cation task. Our proposed method yieldsbetter classi\ufb01cation results in 10of the 15categories, with improvements ranging from 1%to35%. It isnot as good as CAVGA-D u[34] in both pill and capsule categories due to some anomalies similar to thenormal random \ufb01ne-grained pattern like spots that make the distinction more dif\ufb01cult, but the results arestill superior to the baseline method.Tables 2 and 3 show the results of the comparison at the pixel level. Our proposed method is betterthan other methods as a whole on all metrics. PRO is highly demanding on the segmentation performanceof the model under test, and even small areas of anomalous region prediction errors can reduce the valueof this metric. We achieve the best results on grid, leather, and zipper, and leading results in the otherseven categories as well. It is feasible to restore the anomalous portion of the image by resampling inlow-dimensional latent space. Since Venkataramanan et al. [ 34] does not list speci\ufb01c AUROC, we selectedVAE with Attention [ 35] for comparison. Our results at AUROC were better than the second AESSIM [9]with an 8%improvement as Table 3 showed. Bene\ufb01ting from the strong reconstruction capability ofVQ-VAE and the constraint of resampling operations, the score of anomalies portion in the image is muchlarger than the normal portion. This leads to better results than other reconstruction-based methods, whichmostly suffer from false detection due to insuf\ufb01cient reconstruction of the normal portion.Appl.

As shown in Table 4, the average result at the image level is0.89, showing that the proposed model is basically able to correctly distinguish between anomalous andnormal images. For pixel-level classi\ufb01cation, since the number of anomalous pixels is much smaller thannormal pixels, this can greatly affect the precision and thus indirectly the F1 Score. For example, a screwmay have anomalies only in the head, and the number of these anomalous pixels accounts for only 1\u20132%of the image. When the predicted anomaly area is enlarged a bit, the precision may drop by more than50%, but the prediction is intuitively acceptable in terms of pixel continuity. Although the metric assignsequal weights to positive and negative classes, we think the proposed model gives relatively good results,with the mean value 0.17 higher than AE-L2. Furthermore, we present the distribution of anomaly scorefor leather/screw/pill in Figure 6. The proposed model tends to assign high anomaly scores to anomalouspixels and low anomaly scores to normal pixels.Figure 6. The distribution of the anomaly score for pixels. The subplots from left to right are leather, screw,and pill, where the x-axis represents the log of anomaly score, red represents anomaly pixels, and greenrepresents normal pixels.Appl.

The second and \ufb01fth rows are the missing anomalous cableand misplaced transistor separately; these two segmentation results illustrate that the proposed methodcan reconstruct the normal image closest to the anomalous input and thus precisely locate the anomaly.In all of these anomaly types, the segmentation results of the proposed method are roughly the same asground truth, while the other methods can only detect part of them.4.5. Ablation ExperimentTo verify the validity of the proposed anomaly scores and the local constraint on the resamplingoperation, we performed ablation experiments separately. We use the `2distance between input andoutput to get the anomaly score map and give comparison results with the proposed method. We alsocompare the model without the local constraint. The averages of the above three metrics are presented inFigure 8. The results show that, when the anomaly score map is binarized obtained from input and outputresiduals, the threshold needs to be raised to overcome the high anomaly scores in normal regions causedby reconstruction noise, but it also leads to a lower predicted recall yet. The proposed method only hasresiduals in regions with anomalies, thus providing a higher signal-to-noise ratio and precision.Appl.

Results of ablation experiment. Blue is the proposed method, orange is the condition withinput\u2013output residuals as anomaly scores, and grey is the condition without local constraint.With the removal of local constraints, the resampling operation may be affected by noise and may evenaffect the following judgement which leads to lower results. However, models without local constraint arestill better on average than the AE model and are competitive with the state-of-the art.5. ConclusionsDue to the lack of suf\ufb01cient anomaly data relative to normal data, we introduce a novel method foranomaly detection using only normal data. The work can be summarized as follows:Appl. Sci. 2020 ,10, 8660 17 of 19\u000f Using VQ-VAE to construct a discrete latent space. Then, the latent space distribution of the normalimage is modeled using PixelSNAIL.\u000f During anomaly detection, the discrete latent code out of the normal distribution is resampled byPixelSNAIL. After this resampling, the index table is reconstructed to a restored image by the decoder.The greater the distance between the restored image and the image reconstructed directly usingVQ-VAE, the more likely the region is anomalous.\u000f The method is evaluated on the industrial inspection dataset MVTec AD that contains 10objects and\ufb01ve textures with 73various anomalies. The results show that the proposed method achieves betterperformance compared to other methods.Our motivation can be intuitively explained as keeping the normal portions intact while restoringthe abnormal portions of images. Since the time required for resampling and inference is related todimension of the latent space, this may constrain real-time performance of our method. In addition, itis possible to collect a small number of anomalous images in reality, and introducing this anomalousinformation may improve the performance of the model. Future work will focus on real-time performanceand semi-supervised learning.Author Contributions: Project administration, Y.H., L.W.; Validation, D.Z., L.W., and J.G.; investigation, L.W., D.Z.;resources, L.W., D.Z.; visualization, D.Z.

[ 34] and Liu et al. [ 35] implemented Grad-CAM [ 36] into AE, aiming to replace reconstruction errors with the attention mechanism and achieving outstanding performance.\nHaselmann et al. [ 37] treated anomaly detection as an inpainting problem that uses AE trained on the normal dataset to generate patches clipped on the image.\nSimilarly, GANomaly [ 41] adds GAN\u2019s discriminator to AE and encodes the reconstructed image for detecting the anomalies in X-ray images by summing the errors of latent code, reconstruction error, and adversarial loss as anomaly scores.\nWhen VQ-VAE can embed anomaly-free images into a compact discrete latent space and reconstruct high-quality outputs, we start performing the second step.\nSince the latent space is discrete, it can be modeled by deep autoregressive models, and the estimated probability distribution is the basis for the proposed resampling operation.\nSpeci\ufb01cally, as shown in step 1 in Figure 1, given an anomaly-free input image x, the encoder \ufb01rst encodes xinto M\u0002ND-dimensional vectors zethat maintain the two-dimensional spatial structure of theAppl.\nWith the quantization operation, the discrete zcan represent the whole latent space, and thus changing the value of zat prediction stage can generate the desired reconstructed images.\nAs Figure 2 shows, the probability distribution of the current component (red zone) is conditioned only on previous sequences, lacking the semantic information underneath it.\nDetection of Anomalies Based on indexes recorded in the resampled index table, the corresponding embedding vectors can be extracted from the codebook to yield the normal quantized latent code.\nReconstruction-based methods typically calculate the reconstruction error of the input and output the anomaly score, with higher scores representing more likely anomalies.\nAs resampling operation is applied only to components with very low likelihood values in the index table, the results calculated using Equation (6) will only have high anomaly scores in certain regions, reducing the possibility of false alarms.\ncarpet grid tile leather woodmetal nut screw toothbrush transistor zipperbottle cable capsule hazelnut pillobjects textures Figure 4.\nPRO is the relative per-region overlap of the predicted segmentation map Spwith the ground truth Sg, and it gives greater weight to the connectivity component that contains fewer pixels:\nTable 1 shows the average accuracy of correctly classi\ufb01ed anomalous and normal images, which demonstrates the ability of the method in the image-level classi\ufb01cation task.\nIt is not as good as CAVGA-D u[34] in both pill and capsule categories due to some anomalies similar to the normal random \ufb01ne-grained pattern like spots that make the distinction more dif\ufb01cult, but the results are still superior to the baseline method.\nPRO is highly demanding on the segmentation performance of the model under test, and even small areas of anomalous region prediction errors can reduce the value of this metric.\n[26]TexturesCarpet 0.71 0.73 0.67 0.50 0.49 0.63 0.59 Grid 0.91 0.75 0.69 0.78 0.51 0.67 0.50 Wood 0.96 0.85 0.83 0.74 0.68 0.84 0.71 Leather 0.96 0.71 0.46 0.44 0.52 0.67 0.50 Tile 0.95 0.70 0.52 0.77 0.51 0.71 0.72ObjectsBottle 0.99 0.89 0.88 0.80 0.69 0.53 -
